# Server Dashboard

This repository is on the fake server to consume the data in the front-end following the tutorial "Creating a dynamic dashboard".

## Notes

1. Go to my tutorial
2. I do not recommend you to clone this repo, because it is made with My-Json Server, so you would need my account, what I recommend you is that if you want to change the data, create your own server and apply it to what you learned in my tutorial...
